# Heart Disease Prediction Project
Welcome to our Heart Disease Prediction Project! This project was created as the final project for our Data Modeling subject. Our team, consisting of Katherine, Reinhard, Theresia, Tralya, and also me. To support our analysis, we use the [Heart Disease Cleveland](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci) dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains valuable information that enables us to explore various factors influencing the likelihood of heart disease.

## Objectives
The main goal of this project is to predict heart disease using data modeling techniques. We will compare the performance of two powerful algorithms, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, to see which one is more effective in making accurate predictions. Also to ensure a structured and systematic approach, we have adopted the CRISP-DM framework for our project.
